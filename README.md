## 🔍 About InnoPatentGenie

**InnoPatentGenie** is an AI-powered patent search engine designed to revolutionize the way patents are discovered. By leveraging **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)**, it enhances search efficiency, ensuring users get the most relevant results based on their queries.

This project extends our research on **Optimized Linked List Searching**, applying it to patent retrieval systems for faster and smarter patent discovery. 

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ **AI-Optimized Search** – Uses **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)** to improve result accuracy.
- 🔍 **Smart Query Processing** – Understands keywords and ranks patents efficiently.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Insights** – Analyzes search trends for better relevance.
- 🐺 **Inspired by Nature** – GWO mimics wolf hunting strategies for optimization.
- 🛠️ **Dockerized & Scalable** – Easily deployable using **Docker**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍 – Core programming language
- **Flask** 🌐 – Lightweight web framework
- **Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)** 🐺 – Search algorithm
- **SQL/NoSQL** 📂 – Database for storing patents
- **Docker** 🐳 – Containerized deployment

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
